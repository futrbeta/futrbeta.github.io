### Site Information

A site were I will document the process of my ebike build and gather information that essensial or at least useful in the process. The info is likely coming from threads on the endless-sphere.com forum or from the manufaturers homepages. 

The main components is:

* The Flux Beta bike frame, A DIY frame from the minds behind Stealth bomber/fighter bikes.
* The Adaptto system, main components is the motor controller and display but with BMS and charging coil add ons also serv as a charger and battry balancer. 
* And a Leafbike 35mm hub motor.

I hope to be able to provide information that the uninitated find intresting and still be a resource for the guys at endless-sphere that plan use the same components. And of course serve as log for myself, if I ever wondered why I did something one way or where I found that perticular information. 

Its also my first blog using Jekyll, so this will be fun.

Now lets begin the journey.
