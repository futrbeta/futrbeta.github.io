### Site Information

A site where I will document the process of my ebike build and gather information that essential or at least useful in the process. The info is likely coming from threads on the endless-sphere.com forum or from the manufacturers home-pages.

The main components is:

* The Futr Beta bike frame, A DIY frame from the minds behind Stealth bomber/fighter bikes.
* The Adaptto system, main components is the motor controller and display but with BMS and charging coil add-ons it also serve as a charger and battery balancer.
* And a Leafbike 35mm hub motor.

* The battery

* And a [Spotwelder](http://github.com) to create the battery.

I hope to be able to provide information that the uninitiated find interesting and still be a resource for the guys at endless-sphere that plan use the same components. And of course serve as log for myself, if I ever wondered why I did something one way or where I found that particular information.

Its also my first blog using Jekyll, so this will be fun.

Now lets begin the journey.
