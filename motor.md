### Leaf Bike 35mm motor

A frame designed and built by the same team that brought the awesome Stealth[http://stealthelectricbikes.com] Bomber/Fighter bikes to the world.
The beta frame could be seen as a lighter, simpler and cleaner version of the Fighters frame.
It will also be referenced to as Flux Beta frame as it was its name until recently
