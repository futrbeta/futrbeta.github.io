The last vacation day before I will go back to work. Yay! =(

So last week I also got some extra connectors I ordered from ebay, blue XT150s for the phase wires and 7 pin LTT M14 IP68 connectors, don't know the official name for those. That's used for the hall wires and temp sensor.

Breaker

Phase wires

Calculate the Speed ratio for Adaptto.

For this you need to know the number of poles (I guess magnetic poles?) of the motor. It at least the same as the number of magnets used in the motor. In the case of Leafbike 35mm motor its 23.  It also seem that most hubmotor have 23 poles. You also need to know the circumference in mm (omkrest in swedish) of the wheel. In my case with a 24" rim and biltema tire that was 1900.

So 1900/23 is 82,6. So that the number I entered as Speed ratio in Adaptto to get the correct speed displayed.

The beginning of the tests I got 76 km/t in both Normal and Boost modes. But thats with full battery and a incorrect speed ratio.

Witten list of missing components.
