The last vacation day before I will go back to work. Yay! =(

So last week I also got some extra connectors I ordered from ebay, blue XT150s for the phase wires and 7 pin LTT M14 IP68 connectors, don't know the official name for those. They are used for the hall and temp sensor-wires.

**Some Soldering**

**Breaker**

**Phase wires**

**Hall wires and 7 Pin connector.**

**"Hall error 1"**

Running Autodetect, made the motor make some quite awful sound and then failed with "Hall error 1"

After some investigation it was due to a bad connection of atleast one of the hall wires.

Second try with the Autodetect, the motor moved about 10 mm in one direction stops a while and moved 10 mm in the other direction. This continues for maybe a minute and the it stops moving completely. Read somewhere that helping the motor spin might help the process, so I did. And suddenly the display said the Autodetect was completed succesfully.

Not exactly like you seen other Autodetects go, where it moves the wheel 5 cm in the same direction until it begin spinning at full speed for a couple of seconds until it completes. Thinking about it now I realize that I probaly should run the Autodetects a couple of times more. But the again, it runs smooth and quiet as it does.

About the Autodetect, its an amazing feature but its far from perfect. It seem o require a little fiddeling almost every time. But its still many times better then doing the testing manully by your self. =)

**Calculate the Speed ratio for Adaptto.**

For this you need to know the number of poles (I guess magnetic poles?) of the motor. It at least the same as the number of magnets used in the motor. In the case of Leafbike 35mm motor its 23.  It also seem that most hubmotor have 23 poles. You also need to know the circumference in mm (omkrest in swedish) of the wheel. In my case with a 24" rim and biltema tire that was 1900.

So 1900 devide by 23 is 82,6. So that the number I entered as Speed ratio in Adaptto to get the correct speed displayed.

The beginning of the tests I got 76 km/h in both Normal and Boost modes. But thats with full battery (50 volts) and a incorrect speed ratio. Anyway running at full speed with no load consumed between 300 and 500 watts.

Later running at 46 volt and the correct Speed Ratio the motor topped out at 72 km/h

I also written list of missing components, now that I at least got a hunch of all I need I hope I can make some kind of budget calculation.

The motor is humming along quite nicely. So yay! =)
