title: Futr Beta - Whats included?
---
Before ordering the Futr Beta I seen a lot of pictures of other peoples Beta builds. But it never got completely clear exactly what is include when buying the frame.

Buying the frame gave me the answers. :) Hopefully this info is helpful to some of you.

The ballbearings for the swingarm is included and the are already fitted to frame. So no trouble trying to fit these yourself.

The same goes for the Ignition and Ignition Keys. The keyswitch is already fitted and on the 10 cm cables theres small Anderson PowerPole connectors fitted to the ends.
