title: Front Wheel Axle Convertions
---
Got my order from Triton bike containing the front wheel, tyres, tubes and rimband today.

The thing causing me most trouble was the installed quick release axle adapters. Not knowing howto remove them. Trying to find instuctions from Halo failed. At last I found a video on youtube where similar adapters where removed from a hub. The trick is just to pull them out. But you will need a tool, in my case I used a 1mm thick steel wire bent in the end so it go thru the qr hole, but stil is long enough to get hold of the adapter.

Inserting the 20mm Thru axle adapter needed no force at all, the almost fell out again after I inserted them.
