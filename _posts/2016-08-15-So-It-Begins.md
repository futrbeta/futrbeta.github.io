title: So it begins!

So today I got finally got to pick up the package from envolt.se.
It got sent out right after payment, but for some reason the delivery took almost a week.
Thank you PostNord! The package contained the [Futr Beta frame](frame) and the [Adaptto System](/adaptto)

The frame looked as I expected. White and beautiful. :) Unpacking the Adaptto made me realize the controller where much smaller than I expected. Just a couple of cm longer than my 1,5kw China-controller. And this is the 8kw version of the Adaptto. Alot of power in a small package.
