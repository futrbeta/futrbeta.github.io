title: Suspension

My plan to begin with was to "borrow" the suspension, brakes and front wheel from a bike I bought last year. A used bike that never been used. A bargin for â‚¬200 with pretty nice components. But this was before I started learning how many different standards there's in the bike industry. =)

The Beta has a 1 1/8 inch treadless head tube. Not the most commonly used head tube today. Most forks is tapered. You CAN find straigt forks, but theres really limited selection, and from what I found, the fork you want is often sold out or very expensive. On the other hand Dual crown fork often is 1 1/8 inch.

I was looking for a single crown fork, to maintain the stealthy look. A dual crown fork make it look to much like a motorcycle.
And of course the fork should look good and be adjustable.


To top that of, you want your front and rear suspension to at least be somewhat matched.

So I decided to take the easy way out. Buying a fork and rear suspension that is accualy custom made for the Futr Beta frame. Once again from envolt.se. The main issue I have with USD-6 is that it has a reversed design. Where the sensitive part of the fork is down low, making it more to ... damage. If I'm right, only time will tell. =)
