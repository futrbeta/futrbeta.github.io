**Jolt testing.**

Beginning the day with a separately charging the LiPo-packs. (No, the Adaptto BMS is not connected yet)  This also ment that I can test the setup with 18S. And suddenly something interesting happened, I expected a massive jolt, but at first I tested at OVS2, didnt feel a thing. Then I changed to OVS4, and still nothing.

Whats is a little weird is that I began the morning with testing at OVS2 with the somewhat discharged LiPo-packs. At 44volts I did feel the jolt.

So what happens if I try OVS6? An impressive 114km/h that ended in a massive jolt.

**A Big Warning !!!**<br>
You can when tuning the controller live (with full throttle applied) change the parameters. The problem with at least the OVS setting is that pressing left when at OVS0 make it jumps right to OVS7. In my case it resulted in a huge wipeout for the whole rig where I'm testing the motor.

Guess I got lucky cause all that happen was that I hurt a finger, and not at all bad. Its feeling a little numb right now. The worst thing that can happen is that the nail gets blue. :)

As far as I know there where now damages to the motor, rim or rig.
Maybe the rim is more in need of a tuning now then before, but its not clear.


**Noted the following for futr reference:**<br>
**74volts**<br>
114km/h at OVS6 - Big Jolt<br>
102km/h at OVS5 - Small Jolt<br>
93km/h at OVS4 - No Jolt<br>
88km/h at OVS3 - No Jolt<br>
84km/h at OVS2 - No Jolt<br>
76km/h at OVS1 - No Jolt<br>
69km/h at OVS0 - No Jolt<br>

**50volts**<br>
80km/h at OVS4 - Big Jolt<br>
71km/h at OVS3 - Small Jolt<br>
62km/h at OVS2 - No Jolt<br>
58km/h at OVS1 - No Jolt<br>
53km/h at OVS0 - No Jolt<br>

**44volts**<br>
72km/h at OVS4 - Jolted<br>
xxkm/h at OVS2 - Jolted<br>

When it comes to the battery, my plan where trying to fit 24s6p in the frame.
That would mean, a voltage of 96V. An increase of 33 percent. An increase of the top speed at 74. (1,33x114). So 151km/h!, thats a lot faster then I ever wanna go on this bike. That faster then I usually want to go in a car!
