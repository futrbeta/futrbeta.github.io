title: Jolt testing

**Jolt testing.**

Beginning the day with a separately charging the LiPo-packs. (No, the Adaptto BMS is not connected yet)  This also ment that I can test the setup with 18S. And suddenly something interesting happened, I expected a massive jolt, but at first I tested at OVS2, didnt feel a thing. Then I changed to OVS4, and still nothing.

Whats is a little weird is that I began the morning with testing at OVS2 with the somewhat discharged LiPo-packs. At 44volts I did feel the jolt.

So what happens if I try OVS6? An impressive 114km/h that ended in a massive jolt.

**Noted the following for futr reference:**

114km/h at 74volts with OVS6 - Jolted<br>
93km/h at 74volts with OVS4 - No Jolt<br>
93km/h at 74volts with OVS4 - No Jolt<br>
63km/h at 50volts with OVS2 - No Jolt
72km/h at 44volts with OVS4 - Jolted<br>
