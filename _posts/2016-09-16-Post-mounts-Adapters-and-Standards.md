title: Post mounts, adapters and standards.

Where do I begin? Lets see, there are two kinds of disc brake mounts,
IS (International Standard) and Post Mount.

By looking at the specs for DNM USD-6, there should be a IS mount on them.
So what I needed was an IS 180mm adapter and that what I ordered.

But after getting the fork I started to realize that there more custom parts than just the 1 1/8" steerer. Theres also a diffrent wheel (20mm tru axel) and disk brake mounts. Yes can have two cali on these forks. =)

I started to look for adapters from the Post Mounts to an 180mm disc, but started to get confused when there where diffrent adapters to the same size discs. It couldnt be? sure it could. There are 4 diffrent post mounts!

PM 5" for 140mm
PM 6" for 160mm
PM 7" for 180mm
PM 8" for 203mm

And none of them is the standard one!

My theory is that brake and wheel mounts on this custom USD-6 is the same as on the USD-8. At least the look the same the pictures I found. But that does not help one bit. The specs for USD-8 was not to much help either, it just states "Post mount" as kind.

I also contacted the reseller I bought the forks from, and according to him its the standard one. =)

But then I found this.

A drawing with the measurements for the diffrent post mounts.

Measureing the the C and D (65mm and 105mm). so it got to be a 180mm (PM 7") then. Just what I got! Execlent! No need for a adapter then, hopefully.
Will see if thats correct later next week when I get my front wheel.
