After decided what go the route I choose with the suspension, I chose to do a similar thing with the brakes.

Whats the easiest thing to do? Use whats already tried and tested by others.

So I decide to use the same brakes as Stealth use on their bikes. Magura MT5,
powerful enough to stop a bike at speeds similar to what I expect to reach, but also fit in with "the look" I'm aiming for. I know they offer the MT7 as a upgrade as well. But these would be even further outside my expected budget. And if I understood it correctly, its possible to upgrade the brake pads in MT5 to the same ones as in MT7. (4 independent pads instead of 2) As a result that will produce the same stopping power and modulation as the MT7.

Choosed 180mm discs and mount adaptors for the IS mounts on both the swingarms and fork .
