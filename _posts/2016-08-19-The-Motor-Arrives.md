title: The Motor Arrives!
---
16:55 A friday afternoon, perfect for some tests with the motor. If it were not for the since long planed company barbecue evening. =) At least I got time to unpack it in an all-black rim. Instead of those weird looking black rims with silver sides seen on the Leafbike web-site. And its a hole lot heavier than I thought, of course i read the weight on the specs but its something other when you get a feel of it.

Also gets me to realize that the whole bike will be quite heavy to handle. Not something that you easyly througs in the back of the car. (I've got a station wagon =) ) So I might have to think of a way to easyly remove the whole backwheel from the swingarms for easy transportation. The problem the being the phase-, hall- and tempwires from the motor thats neetly attached to the left swingarm.

This could be solved with extra connectors just by the axle, but that could lead to extra powerloss, heat and just more trouble. So have to think about that one.
