title: Back to Work - Week report!

So being back at work make you realize you shall enyoy your free time. =)

**The release-of-throttle-Jolt**

So last report i thougt the motor was "humming along quite nicely".
But I have since realized I had an issue.

Releasing the throttle at what I would call a normal rate made the motor make a jolt. Almost as it where braking. You can really here the clonk them axle makes against the swingarm. And thats what make me realize that this needs to be fixed.

**Brake related?**

First thing I did was to go thrugt the brake settings of Tried to disable as mush as I could. But no improvement.

**Throttle related?**

Next thought was that its throttle related. But after trying it all, Chainging between Speed and Torq mode. Calibrated the throttle multiple time, (both for Start/Stop and linearity)
Even tried another throttle with exactly the same result. See, there was some use for my test set up. Just undo a couple of screws insert the other thottle and tighten them again.



**Speed related?**

So I did a reset of the controller again, ran Autodetect again with mixed results. But at last it seemed like the jolt went away. But the speed it only got up to 50km/h when it got up to 74km/h before.


**So, Tuning related then?**

Just found this post a moment ago.

Where Allex thats running a setup very mush like mine. (Or rather, the other way around ;) ) Is only using OVS 2 on his Leafbike T4 motor, could it be becauce of the Jolt-problem going higher? Have to try that tomorrow. I also remember seeing this post before, this is the reason I went with a 5T motor instead.
